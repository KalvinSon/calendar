I've always have my trusty graph paper pad by my side while I can so that I can draw diagrams I won't be able to understand three days later. I'm a solopreneur for the open source project-turned-business FullCalendar, and I find hand written notes valuable for keeping track of my thoughts.

  <div><img src='{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/homepage-redesign-post/random-sketch.jpg' class='bordered-image' width='372' height='322'></div>
  <div class='image-caption'>this is some really fun caption</div>
</div>

When it came to redesigning the fullcalendar.io homepage, I began scribbling like I normally do. I wanted something more fun and illustrative than the previous homepage, which was spartan to a fault. Please keep in mind I'm a coder by trade, not a designer. What ensued was an educational experience on what translates well from sketch pad to screen and what doesn't.
