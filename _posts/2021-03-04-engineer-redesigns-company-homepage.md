I always have my trusty graph paper notebook by my side. I use it for drawing diagrams I won't be able to understand a day later. I'm a solopreneur for the open source [project-turned-business]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/2019/05/fullcalendar-turns-10) FullCalendar, and scribbling notes and diagrams has become a staple of my workflow.

  <div class='image-caption'>A diagram in my notebook. I sorta kinda remember what I was thinking, but not really.</div>
</div>

I needed to redesign FullCalendar's homepage, so I began scribbling like I normally do. What started as a boring wireframe began evolving into something much more illustrative. I raced to my local art supplies store for some color markers.

Just to be clear, I'm an engineer, **not** a graphic design person. I was suren't any if these ideas would translate to the screen. After hiring an extremely talented designer, I would find out...

Turns out it's best to have your call to action on the left (for LTR languages at least). Also, stay away from overly exotic buttons because they won't look clickable.

I was happy the Star Wars code-scroll made it in.

My designer tried a million iterations of a cartoony looking lightning bolt. A more realistic one made the final cut.

The sassy emoji girl needed to be removed because it made the design look too busy (and too vein <img src='{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/homepage-redesign-post/sassy-emoji.png' width='32' height='32'>).

For the beach scene, only the [Octocat](https://octodex.github.com/) survived. The speedboat and the treasure chest, which linked to the payment page (get it?), were replaced by some **ingenious** magical narwhals that I can't take credit for.

Designing the new homepage was a breath of fresh air from coding all day. It might be a bit too whimsical for its own good given that it's a JavaScript library, but who cares. When you run your own company, you do what you want :)
