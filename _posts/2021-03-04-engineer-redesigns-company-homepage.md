I always have my trusty graph paper notebook by my side. I use it for drawing diagrams I won't be able to understand a day later. I'm a solopreneur for the open source [project-turned-business]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/2019/05/fullcalendar-turns-10) FullCalendar, and scribbling notes and diagrams has become a staple of my workflow.

<div class='split-image'>
  <div><img src='{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/homepage-redesign-post/random-sketch.jpg' class='bordered-image' width='372' height='322'></div>
  <div style='margin:0 1em'>
    <div class='image-caption'>A diagram in my notebook. Most of the meaning is now lost on me.</div>
  </div>
</div>

I needed to redesign FullCalendar's homepage, so I began scribbling like I normally do. What started as a boring wireframe began evolving into something much more illustrative. I raced to my local art supplies store for some color markers.

Just to be clear, I'm an engineer, **not** a graphic design person. I wasn't sure if any of these ideas would translate to the screen. After hiring an [extremely talented designer](http://allie-surdovel.com/), I would find out.

I intended the first section to have a depiction of FullCalendar's calendar product. It transitions into a Star Wars-esque space scroll of code underneath. Lucky this worked out! What did **not** make the cut were my unorthodox button and tab styles because they didn't look clickable:

<div class='bleedout'>
  <div class='split-image'>
    <div><img src='{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/homepage-redesign-post/part1-sketch.jpg' class='bordered-image' width='530' height='533'></div>
    <div><img src='{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/homepage-redesign-post/part1-screenshot.png' class='bordered-image' width='530' height='533'></div>
  </div>
</div>

The following scene takes place in the clouds and contains a lightning bolt. My designer and I struggled with numerous cartoony bolts until she recommended a more realistic rendition that is really unique and matches perfectly with the rest of the illustrations.

If you glance below, you'll see I intended the "sassy emoji girl" <img src='{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/homepage-redesign-post/sassy-emoji.png' width='32' height='32'> to be sitting atop the mountain. Unfortunately the mountain was too shrouded in logos to accommodate her:

<div class='bleedout'>
  <div class='split-image'>
    <div><img src='{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/homepage-redesign-post/part2-sketch.jpg' class='bordered-image' width='530' height='556'></div>
    <div><img src='{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/homepage-redesign-post/part2-screenshot.png' class='bordered-image' width='530' height='556'></div>
  </div>
</div>

The nautical-themed section that follows contains many elements that were gutted. Only the [Octocat](https://octodex.github.com/) survived. My tacky speedboat and treasure chest, which links to the payment page (get it?), were replaced by some **ingenious** magical narwhals I can't take credit for:

<div class='bleedout'>
  <div class='split-image'>
    <div><img src='{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/homepage-redesign-post/part3-sketch.jpg' class='bordered-image' width='530' height='360'></div>
    <div><img src='{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/homepage-redesign-post/part3-screenshot.png' class='bordered-image' width='530' height='360'></div>
  </div>
</div>

Working on this design was a breath of fresh air from coding all day. While some may find it a bit too illustrative for an open source project's homepage, it was an excuse for me to have fun and wear another hat within my company. I'm very curious to hear what others think!
