Bootstrap 4 support has been released in FullCalendar [v3.9.0](https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/releases/tag/v3.9.0). Big thanks to <a href="https://github.com/geekjosh" target="_blank"><strong>@GeekJosh</strong></a> for the [PR](https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/pull/4065)!

Just set your [themeSystem](https://fullcalendar.io/docs/themeSystem) setting to &#8216;bootstrap4&#8217; and make sure to include a Bootstrap 4 stylesheet AND a FontAwesome stylesheet.

Unlike Bootstrap 3 which comes with Glyphicons, [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/) does not come with a defacto icon set. In order to create a connector for FullCalendar we had to choose an icon set, so we chose FontAwesome. To learn more, read the <a href="https://fontawesome.com/get-started" target="_blank">FontAwesome Getting Started</a> page as well the FullCalendar [bootstrapFontAwesome](https://fullcalendar.io/docs/bootstrapFontAwesome) setting.

In other news, [Scheduler v1.9.3](https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar-scheduler/releases/tag/v1.9.3) has been released.
