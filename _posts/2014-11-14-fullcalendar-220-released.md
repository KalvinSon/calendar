**Version 2.2.0 has been released.** It contains some highly-demanded features:

* [Background events]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/event_rendering/Background_Events/)Â and [business hours]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/display/businessHours/)
* Preventing events from overlapping. See [eventOverlap]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/event_ui/eventOverlap/) and [selectOverlap]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/selection/selectOverlap/).
* Constraining events to certain periods of time. See [eventConstraint]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/event_ui/eventConstraint/) and [selectConstraint]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/selection/selectConstraint/).
* A much easier way to implement drag-n-drop for external events. See [eventReceive]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/dropping/eventReceive/), [droppable]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/dropping/droppable/), and the [demo file](https://github.com/arshaw/fullcalendar/blob/v2.2.0/demos/external-dragging.html).

See the [changelog](https://github.com/arshaw/fullcalendar/releases/tag/v2.2.0) for a full list of changes.
