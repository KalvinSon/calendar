title: A Contributor-Powered Release

Version 2.8.0 is the first release to contain mostly code that I did NOT write: it was written by contributors of the project who submitted their modifications via [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/). Here is a summary of those changes:

* event-source related methods and fixes (big thanks to [@caseyjhol](https://github.com/caseyjhol))
* jQuery 3 support
* 3 new languages

For a full list of changes, see the [Release Notes](https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/releases/tag/v2.8.0).

Many of these Pull Requests were long overdue to merge, so apologies and thanks to the authors. I&#8217;m going to be better about collaborating with code contributors going forward.

I&#8217;m going to be improving the [lackluster docs](https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-features) for contributing as well as explicitly outlining how feature requests are prioritized. I will be announcing this in my next blog post.

Cheers to a healthy collaborative project!
