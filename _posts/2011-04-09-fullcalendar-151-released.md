FullCalendar 1.5.1 has been released. This is a minor bugfix release and has been tested and bundled with jQuery 1.5.2.


## Browser Testing

FullCalendar has been tested with the newly released Firefox 4, and everything is shipshape. Also, because it uses the latest jQuery, it is now compatible with Internet Explorer 9.

Developers have reported success using FullCalendar with IE9 and have filed no bugs, however, I have yet to do a full QA test in IE9 because I do not own Windows 7. Would anyone be able to hook me up with a legitimate copy? I would be eternally grateful! I own Windows XP and can upgrade from that. Here is my Amazon wishlist: <a title="" href="http://amzn.com/w/1CYNE5Z5420QK" target="_blank">http://amzn.com/w/1CYNE5Z5420QK</a> (UPDATE: got it! see my comment below)
