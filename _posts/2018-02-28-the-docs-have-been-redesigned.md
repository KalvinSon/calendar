After years of accumulating dozens and dozens of new articles and settings and essentially resembling one huge wall of poorly-organized links, the documentation page has been refactored to be more approachable for first-time users of the project.<!--more--> The index of the documentation page now sports an array of illustrations that abstractly depict each given feature. You can click into each section to see the child articles.

[Visit the new docs page »](https://fullcalendar.io/docs)

However, if you've grown accustomed to the old documentation and prefer one huge table-of-contents, then move your mouse on over to this icon:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/blog/docs-toc-icon.png" alt="toc icon" width="97" height="75" />

This will convert the docs page into a hierarchy of links, all accessible from a single page. Upon subsequent visits to the docs, the site will remember your preference. The groupings of each article are different than before, so apologies if it requires a bit of relearning.

We plan to implement a search feature, probably with [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/). Until then, please make due with your browser's Cmd/Ctl+F functionality on the table-of-contents page.

Best of all, there are more **interactive demos** with runnable source-code, which can be edited in CodePen. The end-goal is to make runnable code samples available for every single setting, and we&#8217;re off to a good start. The demos are listed on the right hand side of each section and are linked-to from various sub-articles.

The docs are hosted in a <a href="https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar-site-static" target="_blank">GitHub repo</a>. Contributions are more than welcome!

Please leave a comment with your reactions and suggestions for the new docs. We would love to hear how we can make them better!

**Update (March 10th): **based on feedback, the &#8220;hierarchy of links&#8221;, the mode for powerusers, has been redesigned to fit more links on the page. See this screenshot:
