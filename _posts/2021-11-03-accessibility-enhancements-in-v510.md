The most recent minor release ([v5.10.0][v5.10.0]) massively improves accessibility for screen
readers and keyboard-only usage. It implements the following:

- Adds useful titles/labels to all interactive elements
- Makes all interactive elements tabbable, allowing simple keyboard actions on focused elements
- Provides hints to screen readers for better table interaction
