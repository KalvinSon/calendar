**The past year was a good year for FullCalendar!** Aside from the usual bugfixing, three out of the five top requested features were implemented:

* [horizontal resource view]({{ site.baseurl }}/pricing) (aka &#8220;Timeline&#8221;)
* [vertical resource view]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/vertical-resource-view)
* [current time indicator]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/nowIndicator)

The resource views were particularly time intensive to build. They have been bundled into [Scheduler, a premium add-on]({{ site.baseurl }}/pricing) introduced in 2015 as well.

Scheduler sales of are doing well, and as a result, the health and productivity of the project is better than ever. Thank you to those who purchased licenses!

## Q1 Roadmap

The quarter will be sprinkled with a number of bugfix releases, including a soon-to-be-released <a href="https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar-scheduler/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AStatus-Confirmed" target="_blank">set of bugfixes</a> for Scheduler.

In addition, accessibility-related features will be addressed early in the quarter:

* <a href="https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/994" target="_blank">drag-n-drop / resize / selection with touch devices</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Ai18n" target="_blank">i18n contributions</a>

Afterwards, features considered to be high-impact, low-effort will be tackled:

* <a href="https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/429" target="_blank">restrict date range</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/424" target="_blank">clickable day numbers for easier navigation</a>

Then, there will be some general internal refactoring to allow for:

* <a href="https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/564" target="_blank">dynamic setters for all options</a>
* groundwork for additional views

## Beyond Q1

The focus of Q2 and beyond will be to bring new views to life (such as <a href="https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/560" target="_blank">list view</a> and <a href="https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/1140" target="_blank">year view</a>), as well as introduce fundamentals changes to existing views (such as <a href="https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/2276" target="_blank">continuous scrolling of months</a> and <a href="https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/820" target="_blank">drag-n-drop between calendar</a>).

Thank you for your continued support of the FullCalendar project!
