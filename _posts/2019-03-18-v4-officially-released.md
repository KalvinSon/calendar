A year after the project first began, version 4 is _finally_ released. A tremendous amount of work went into it.<!--more--> To summarize the advancements over v3:

  * jQuery has been removed
  * Moment has been removed and time zones have been rethought
  * The API is more modern
  * Functionality is broken into lightweight plugins
  * Plugins have been added for recurring events, Moment, and Luxon
  * Touch interactions and scrolling work better
  * Lots of internal refactoring that has already made development _much_ faster

And the icing on the cake, the toolbar and event styling has been updated:

Anyway, I&#8217;m tired of writing blog posts about v4, so I&#8217;ll end it here. I want to thank all those who beta tested and submitted bug reports and PRs. It was incredibly helpful!
