A year after the project first began, version 4 is _finally_ released. A tremendous amount of work went into it.<!--more--> To summarize the advancements over v3:

* jQuery has been removed
* Moment has been removed and time zones have been rethought
* The API is more modern
* Functionality is broken into lightweight plugins
* Plugins have been added for recurring events, Moment, and Luxon
* Touch interactions and scrolling work better
* Lots of internal refactoring that has already made development _much_ faster

And the icing on the cake, the toolbar and event styling has been updated:

Anyway, I&#8217;m tired of writing blog posts about v4, so I&#8217;ll end it here. I want to thank all those who beta tested and submitted bug reports and PRs. It was incredibly helpful!
