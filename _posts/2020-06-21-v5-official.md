The FullCalendar v5 [Release Candidate]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2020-06-16-v5-rc-new-features %}) went very well. There were only a few minor bugfixes (see the [changelog](https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/releases/tag/v5.0.0)).

After months of hard work, v5 has been officially released! Thanks to everyone for all the testing and feedback. If you haven't already seen it, <a href='{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/upgrading-from-v4' class='more-link'>view the Upgrade Guide</a>
