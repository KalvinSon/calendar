Events that appear as background highlights can be achieved by setting an [Event Object](event-object)'s `rendering` property to `"background"`:

```js
$('#calendar').fullCalendar({
  defaultDate: '2014-11-10',
  defaultView: 'agendaWeek',
  events: [
    {
      start: '2014-11-10T10:00:00',
      end: '2014-11-10T16:00:00',
      rendering: 'background'
    }
  ]
});
```

Result:

Background events that are **timed** will only be rendered on the time slots in agenda view. Background events that are **all-day** will only be rendered in month view or the all-day slots of agenda view.


## Color

The color of background events can be manipulated by targeting the `fc-bgevent` className, one of your own custom classNames provided by the [Event Object](event-object)'s `className` property, or by explicitly specifying a color with each [Event Object](event-object)'s or [Event Source](event-source-object)'s `color` or `backgroundColor` properties.


## Recurring Events

It is possible to define daily or weekly recurring events. Use [Duration](moment-duration)-ish times in the [Event Object](event-object)'s `start` and `end` properties, or use the `dow` property. See [businessHours](businessHours) for more information.


## Inverse Backgrounds

The spans of time *not* occupied by an event can be colored by setting the `rendering` property to `"inverse-background"`. Events that share the same `id` will be grouped together when this rendering happens.
