FullCalendar's Touch support includes smooth scrolling, time-range selection via long-press, and event drag-n-drop/resizing via long-press.

These improvements are available since FullCalendar v2.7.0 and [Scheduler](scheduler) v1.3.0.

On a touch device, for the user to begin drag-n-dropping events, **they must first tap-and-hold on the event in order to "select" it!**
