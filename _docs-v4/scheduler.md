FullCalendar "Scheduler" is the name for a collection of premium plugins. There are currently two distinct plugins that provide new views, both of which are good at displaying *resources* (things that events can be assigned to, like rooms):

- [Timeline View](timeline-view) - good at displaying a large number of resources
- [Vertical Resource View](vertical-resource-view) - good at displaying a fewer number of resources

Scheduler is a [premium product]({{ site.baseurl }}/purchase) that has different licensing than the core FullCalendar library.
