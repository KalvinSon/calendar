Methods provide ways to manipulate the calendar from JavaScript code.<!--more--> A method operates on the jQuery object of a calendar that has already been initialized, using the familiar `fullCalendar` command, but in a completely different way:

```js
calendar.next();
```

This will call the [next](next) method and will force to the calendar to move to the next month/week/day.
