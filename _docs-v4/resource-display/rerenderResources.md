title: rerenderResources

Rerenders all resources on the calendar.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
.rerenderResources()
</div>

This includes the left cells in [Timeline View](timeline-view) and the top header in [Vertical Resource View](vertical-resource-view). It will **not** rerender the events associated with the resources.
