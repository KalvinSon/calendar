FullCalendar "Scheduler" is the name for a collection of premium plugins. There are currently two distinct plugins that provide new views, both of which are good at displaying *resources* (things that events can be assigned to, like rooms):

- [Timeline View](timeline-view) - good at displaying a large number of resources
- [Vertical Resource View](vertical-resource-view) - good at displaying a fewer number of resources

Scheduler is a premium product that has different licensing than the standard FullCalendar library.

## Package Managers

FullCalendar Scheduler is available on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/). You'll first need to install FullCalendarâ€™s `core` package as well as the premium plugins you plan to use. For example, the following is how you install [Resource Timeline View](timeline-view):

```sh
npm install --save @fullcalendar/core @fullcalendar/resource-timeline
```
