When not all events will fit in a given day, you can display the excess events in a small window that will show up when the user clicks a "more" link.

This UI component only applies to [Month view](month-view), [DayGrid view](daygrid-view), and the "all-day" slot of [TimeGrid view](timegrid-view).
